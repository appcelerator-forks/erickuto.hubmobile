      "about": "A (hopefully!) soon-to-be graduate of the Clinton School of Public Service, I am excited to complete my MPS degree as an A-Year Associate with Ashoka. Born and raised in Miami, FL, I accidentally stumbled into social entrepreneurship while studying at Washington University in St. Louis and havenâ€™t looked back since. I am particularly interested in and passionate about working with social entrepreneurs as they develop organization and infrastructure around their ideas. This summer I partnered with two entrepreneurs working out of Hub Brussels to develop revenue strategies for their initiatives. An aspiring foodie, a bit of an exercise and health nut, and an avid traveler, I look forward to working with the incredible team of people that Ashoka has assembled.\r\n\r\nMost importantly to this space - I recently joined the AshokaHub team! If I can ever be of support/assistance to any of you, please do not hesitate to leave me a message here, at jaibel@ashoka.org. or at jordanaibel on Skype.\r\n\r\nHave a great day! ",

      "your_problem": "To create sustainable solutions to the toughest challenges our world faces, we must re-imagine the purpose of education.  A transformed education system will develop a new generation of leaders and entrepreneurs to solve poverty, disease, violence, and environmental degradation. ",
      "your_solution": "Eric is dedicated to transforming the education system of Uganda so that it equips young people with the leadership skills necessary to become change-makers in their communities. His organization, Educate, addresses the core problem of an outdated education system that has not produced the leadership needed to resolve social ills in Ugandan society.",
      "your_strategy": "Educate! develops young leaders and entrepreneurs in Uganda by providing long-term mentorship and two-years of world-class leadership and entrepreneurship training to help high school students start enterprises that solve poverty, disease, violence and environmental degradation.  Educate!â€™s alumni program provides ongoing mentorship, training, and access to capital to amplify the impact our students have after graduation.  Our model is exponential empowerment â€“ a long term investment in youth so they can positively impact many others throughout their lives.  We work with 3,600 diverse young leaders and entrepreneurs across Uganda â€“ the next Nelson Mandela, Wangari Maathai and Mahatma Gandhi of Africa. \r\n\r\nTransforming the education system: Educate! partnered with the government of Uganda and the UN International Labor Organization (ILO) to incorporate its leadership and entrepreneurship curriculum into the national education system.  The curriculum now reaches 25,000 students annually. ",
      "your_trends": "The Ugandan education system has failed to produce the type of leadership needed to solve persistent social problems of poverty; high youth unemployment; and rising rates of crime, HIV/AIDS transmissions and environmental degradation. With 50 percent of the population under the age of 25, Ugandaâ€™s youth must be equipped with the skills and experiences needed to recognize, create and lead solutions to these intractable problems, or they will only contribute to them in the future.\r\n\r\nA recent report by BRAC Uganda argues that completion of the last two years of high school (A level) has no positive economic outcomes for the individual."

Upon being awarded a Fulbright grant in 2010, David spent a year coordinating the Venture process in Ashokaâ€™s Mexico and Central America office before moving to the Global office.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming passionate in high school about human rights and political issues in Latin America through academic trips to Oaxaca and El Salvador, David continued on to Claremont McKenna College, where he graduated with a degree in International Relations and Spanish. During college, David studied abroad in Buenos Aires and wrote his thesis on the consequences to democracy of the Central American Free Trade Agreement. David was also co-President of the Students for Peace and Justice Coalition, the International Editor for a campus political journal and the host of a nightly lecture program, where he organized a speaker series on GLBT issues.\r\n\r\nLong interested in public affairs, David first worked at the Arizona Governorâ€™s office and at a CSO that focus on U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. He is now excited to be at Ashoka to learn how social entrepreneurs influence and affect large-scale policy change.\r\n\r\nDavid has been playing the trumpet since elementary school, and he has performed in ensembles dedicated to jazz, classical and most recently mariachi music.
